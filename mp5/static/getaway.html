    No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
    <br>
    It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
    I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
    But I didn't mean it<br>
    And you didn't see it<br>
    The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
    In shades of gray and candlelight<br>
    I wanted to leave him<br>
    I needed a reason<br>
    <br>
    X marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
    He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself<br>
    I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
    We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (oh!)<br>
    <br>
    You were drivin' the getaway car<br>
    We were flyin', but we'd never get far<br>
    Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
    Think about the place where you first met me<br>
    Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
    There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
    Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
    Think about the place where you first met me<br>
    In a getaway car (oh-oh-oh)<br>
    No, they never get far (oh-oh-ah)<br>
    No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
    <br>
    It was the great escape, the prison break<br>
    The light of freedom on my face<br>
    But you weren't thinking<br>
    And I was just drinking<br>
    Well, he was running after us, I was screaming, "Go, go, go!"<br>
    But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow<br>
    And a circus ain't a love story<br>
    And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)<br>
    <br>
    X marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
    He poisoned the well, every man for himself<br>
    I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
    It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart<br>
    <br>
    You were drivin' the getaway car<br>
    We were flyin', but we'd never get far<br>
    Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
    Think about the place where you first met me<br>
    Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
    There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
    Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
    Think about the place where you first met me<br>
    In a getaway car (oh-oh-oh)<br>
    No, they never get far (oh-oh-ah)<br>
    No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
    <br>
    We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh, oh)<br>
    Until I switched to the other side, to the other si-i-i-i-ide<br>
    It's no surprise, I turned you in (oh, oh)<br>
    'Cause us traitors never win<br>
    I'm in a getaway car<br>
    I left you in the motel bar<br>
    Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys<br>
    That was the last time you ever saw me<br>
    <br>
    Drivin' the getaway car<br>
    We were flyin', but we'd never get far (don't pretend)<br>
    Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
    Think about the place where you first met me<br>
    Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
    There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known)<br>
    Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
    Think about the place where you first met me<br>
    In a getaway car (oh-oh-oh)<br>
    No, they never get far (oh-oh-ah)<br>
    No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
    <br>
    I was ridin' in a getaway car<br>
    I was cryin' in a getaway car<br>
    I was dyin' in a getaway car<br>
    Said "goodbye" in a getaway car<br>
    Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
    I was cryin' a getaway car<br>
    I was dyin' in a getaway car<br>
    Said "goodbye" in a getaway car<br>
